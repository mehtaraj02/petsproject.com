<h1><center>PETS</center></h1>
<center>Fish are the most popular pets in the world, and nearly all households have at least one fish or more.
    Their aquariums are lovely home decors and are fairly easy to care for and maintain.Fish are great pets because they don't need training, playtime, or grooming.
    Fish are very calming. Watching a fish swim through the water is very tranquil and relaxing. You don't have to worry about a fish making too much noise like a barking dog.

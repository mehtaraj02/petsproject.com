<h1><center>PETS</center></h1>
<center>A pet monkey is a monkey kept as a pet.One of the benefits of having a monkey as pet as opposed to other household animals is that monkeys have opposable thumbs. If trained properly they could lend a hand with chores around the house.
  With this in mind monkeys would be considered more of an investment instead of an unnecessary cost.

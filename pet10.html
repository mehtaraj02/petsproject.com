<center>Ferrets are a natural choice for most exotic animal lovers. They are spritely, fun, and cute. In addition to that, most pet stores keep and carry food for them, so sustaining a few ferrets long-term should not be an issue.
    The ferret is a small, domesticated species belonging to the family Mustelidae. The ferret is most likely a domesticated form of the wild European polecat, evidenced by their interfertility. Other mustelids include the stoat, badger and mink.

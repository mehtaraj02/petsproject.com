<center>Pigeons are one of the cute pets also loyal, loving companions who can express affection just as well as any other pet.
    Pigeons often enjoy being taken out of their enclosure and being held and petted, or riding on a favorite human's shoulder or head.
    Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals.
    Pigeons are smart, easy going birds that quickly learn household routines.
    They do fine in homes with other pets and can live peacefully and unafraid with dogs and cats as long as they are kept safe.
    Pigeons are very emotional and do need a BFF, whether another bird or a human with whom they can spend the day.

<center>Sheep are good pets because they are a gentle animal and respond well to human contact.Sheep make great projects for children.
    They are suitable for children with most disabilities.They can be playful and comical animals that form close bonds with their people. Raising one by bottle-feeding forms an even stronger bond since the sheep will think you are their mother. Most sheeps get along great with children and other pets.

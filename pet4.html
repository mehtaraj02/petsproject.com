<center>Ducks are  relatively small, short-necked, large-billed waterfowl.They will follow you everywhere and remain loyal for life if interaction is continued. Ducks are social birds, so they appreciate having at least one other duck in their flock
    In general, ducks are more difficult to take care of than other pets, such as dogs or cats, because their environment needs to be closely monitored.
    They are also social animals that like to be kept in pairs or groups

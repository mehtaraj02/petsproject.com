<h1><center>PETS</center></h1>
<center>My favorite type of pet has always been a dog. They're loyal,kind and offer endless affection.
    Dogs are sometimes referred to as man's best friend because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.
    They are also helpful in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, loneliness, encourage exercise and playfulness and even improve your cardiovascular health.

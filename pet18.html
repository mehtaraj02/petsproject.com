<h1><center>PETS</center></h1>
<center>Cows are one of the most innocent animals who are very harmless.A cow needs space to move around and graze, and is not happy kept in one small area all the time.
    They also make a lot of manure, can get quite dirty, and even noisy when they're hungry or when they get in heat
    Not many people think of having a cow as a pet, but it's fairly easy—and enjoyable—to keep one or several animals this way on your hobby farm.
    Just like us, some of the most important things to cows are tasty feed, a nice place to sleep and relax, and a chance to socialize with friends.

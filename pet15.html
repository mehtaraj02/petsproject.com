<center>Pet tortoises are popular pets for many people since they are quiet, cute and don't shed any fur. But tortoises can live a very long time (anywhere from 50 to 100 years).
  They are not an ideal pet to keep indoors, and not a pet that is played with, cuddled, or handled very often. Tortoises thrive best where they get sunshine and fresh air.
  They Are Low Maintenance. When we talk of other animals like a dog or a cat, we also have to look at their maintenance level. ...
  They Don't Shed,They Are Super Clean and They Are Super Friendly.

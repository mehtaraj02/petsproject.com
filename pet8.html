<h1><center>PETS</center></h1>
<center>Birds come in fourth place. They are not quite as popular as fish, or cats, but they are just as fun and rewarding to nurture.Cockatiels, parrots, and other birds with some capacity to mimic human speech are particularly popular among bird owners.
    Birds make great pets and owning a bird can be a seriously rewarding experience. They are sociable, intelligent, and with the right socialization, can form wonderful bonds with their families. They even do well in homes with children, and are relatively easy (and inexpensive) to care for and train

<center>Rabbits are very loving, social animals, which means they not only love to spend time with their humans â€“ they require it.
  Rabbits have long ears, a short tail, long hind legs, and continuously growing incisors.Rabbits make great pets for children. However, they are fragile and young children should not handle them

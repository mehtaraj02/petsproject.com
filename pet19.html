<h1><center>PETS</center></h1>
<center>Goats are fun! They enjoy interacting with humans, are easy to feed, will eat weeds, and don't take up too much space.
  Goats prefer eating woody plants (browsing), though they'll also graze on grasses and weeds.
  Goats show affection by asking to be petted. They are not like dogs who like to be pet on their backs.
  Goats like to be petted in specific areas of their body. When a goat is happy to be around someone, they will often follow them everywhere they go.
